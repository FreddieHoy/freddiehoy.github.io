    Profile - Interests
    <br />
    I am a recent graduate from the 12 week Software Engineering Immersive course @ General Assembly London.

    Before the course, I graduated with a 1st class Masters degree in Mechanical Engineering and then worked in the automotive manufactuing industry.

    Since completing the course, I belive that Software engineering might be one of the purest forms problem solving, providing challanges that engineers, like myself, twitch for.

    <br />
    I am now looking to apply my coding abilities to opportunities as a Web Developer.
