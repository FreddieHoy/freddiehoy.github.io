      <h1>Profile</h1>
      <p>I am a recent graduate from the 12 week Software Engineering Immersive course @ General Assembly London.
      <br />
      <br />
      Before the course, I graduated with a 1st class Masters degree in Mechanical Engineering and then worked in the automotive manufactuing industry.
      <br />
      <br />
      Since completing the course, I belive that Software engineering might be one of the purest forms problem solving, providing challanges that engineers, like myself, twitch for.
      <br />
      <br />
      I am now looking to apply my coding abilities to opportunities as a Web Developer.</p>

        The idea for this App was to allow users to share their home-cooked meals with one another by posting an image with a description and allowing other users to comment. The user can see their profile page and a news feed. Learning Python in two weeks and then using Django was a steep learning curve, but the outcome was a success.</p>

        The idea for this app was for users to share space in their garden for other users to grow food in, joining the sustainable food movement growing in London right now. This was my first group project extensively using Git to collaborate on the project. We started with the backend by using test-driven development to create RESTful routes for our API. Connecting the front end and using react. Most of my work was on the backend, searching using React-mapbox, styling and the homepage. </p>

        <img src="images/boredgames.png" alt="Bored Games homepage" class="screenshot shadow">
        <p>The project was focused on consuming an API and using RESTful routes. We consumed a board game API with very useful data allowing us to display a search page for board games which by the number of players, genre, length of time, game mechanics (ie. dice), price and more. However, the API only gave us 100 games for free. We also used the CSS framework Bulma.</p>

      <p><span class="text-bold">Cycling</span> - Has been my most recent passion and project. In September 2017, I organized a completely self- sufficient bike tour for 9 days cycling from Nice, France to Barcelona, Spain. The cycle took 8 days covering 900km. Along with 2 university friends, we raised £3,500 for charity in memory of our family members who have affected by cancer. <br />

      <p><span class="text-bold">Sports</span> - Play a wide variety of sports at school and University, such as football, hockey (BUCS & Captain), squash and golf. In my gap year, I completed the New Generation 'ski Gap' course and became a qualified ski instructor.</p>

      <p><span class="text-bold">Travelling</span> - Very keen traveler, having been to places such as Asia, Africa, and Australia & New Zealand. In 2012, I took part in a trek across Ethiopia, 22km a day in a team of 8, completing various challenges and visiting schools. My travels have allowed me to pursue my love for scuba diving. Recently came back from Indonesia where I dived at 2 of the top 10 ranked dive sites in the world, which was an unbelievable experience. (August 2016).</p>
